### Game Instructions 
The game board is numbered from 1 to 9, starting from the top-left corner.
Each player takes turns to place their marker ('X' or 'O') on the board.
The first player to align three of their markers horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
If the board is full and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.
Enjoy the game!
